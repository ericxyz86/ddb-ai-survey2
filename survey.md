# DDB Group Philippines Generative AI Skills Gap & Agency Survey

## Introduction

Welcome to the DDB Group Philippines Generative AI Skills Gap & Agency Survey. In today's rapidly evolving landscape, AI is transforming how we work by amplifying individual impact rather than simply replacing jobs. This survey aims to identify both technical skills gaps and, more importantly, those with high "agency" â€“ the ability to take initiative, work across domains, and leverage AI to accomplish goals without specialized expertise. Your responses will help us develop a training approach that empowers the right individuals to drive AI adoption across our organization.
